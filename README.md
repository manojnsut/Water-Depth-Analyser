# Water Depth Analyser using Deep Learning and Flood Simulation	
- Proposed a deep learning-based image model to predict the depth of water using real-world flood simulations.
- Generated a dataset using a flood simulation environment on the **Unity** platform with raycast and shader graphs.
- Utilized **ResNet-152V2** to train the deep learning model on a dataset generated from the Unity simulation.
- Achieved an overall accuracy of **84.63%** on the Unity flood simulation labeled dataset of **10,000 images**.
